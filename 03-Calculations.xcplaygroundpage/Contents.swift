//: ## Calculations
//: You can use a playground like a calculator. Type in the math problem you want solved and the results sidebar shows the answer, or the _result_, of the calculation.
//:
//: You can use the plus `+` and minus `-` signs for addition and subtraction just as youâ€™d expect:
34 + 56 + 230

1000 - 300

3+4+2+5+3+1+5+8+4+9+3+0

//: For multiplication, use the asterisk `*` :
3 * 100
9*8*7*6*5*5*4*3*2*1
//: For division, use the slash `/` :
24 / 8

5/9
//: For grouping, use parenthesis `( )` :
(300 + 500 + 400) / 3

(5/9) * 5 * 4 * 2 * 29 * 100
//: - experiment:\
//: Practice using the playground like a calculator.
//: Edit some of the existing expressions and a few of your own.
//: Notice every time you make a change the results are updated in the sidebar.
